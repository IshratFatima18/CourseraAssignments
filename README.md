In this course you will cover HTML5, CSS3, Twitter Bootstrap CSS Framework, which is the most widely used CSS framework today.<br><br>
I think the coolest part of this course is that after learning the fundamentals, you're actually going to take a field trip to one of the
local businesses in Baltimore, which doesn't have a good website, take down the requirements, and build a real website for that business from scratch.<br>

You have to pass all 5 peer graded assignments to complete the course.

Follow these steps to test the web app:<br>
1)Once the page loads, open up Chrome Developer Tools and switch to the Console tab.<br>
2) If the assignment is implemented correctly, you should see the following output there:<br>

Hello Yaakov<br>
Good Bye John<br>
Good Bye Jen<br>
Good Bye Jason<br>
Hello Paul<br>
Hello Frank<br>
Hello Larry<br>
Hello Paula<br>
Hello Laura<br>
Good Bye Jim<br>
3) Click on the Sources tab in the Chrome Developer Tools. Look for the file 'script.js'. If not there, click the "Reload" button to reload the web page. The 'script.js' file should show up.<br>

Investigate the file to make sure the code does NOT look like someone simply called console.log manually on each name, i.e.,<br>

console.log("Hello Yaakov");<br>
console.log("Good Bye John");<br>
console.log("Good Bye Jen");<br>
etc.
Make sure you see calls to the helloSpeaker and byeSpeaker objects.
